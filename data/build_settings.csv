GCC_USE_STANDARD_INCLUDE_SEARCHING,Use Standard System Header Directory Searching,"Controls whether the standard system directories are searched for header files. When disabled, only the directories you have specified with `-I` options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched."
GCC_C_LANGUAGE_STANDARD,C Language Dialect,"Choose a standard or non-standard C language dialect.

- _ANSI C:_ Accept ISO C90 and ISO C++, turning off GNU extensions that are incompatible. `-ansi` Incompatible GNU extensions include the `asm`, `inline`, and `typeof` keywords (but not the equivalent ` __asm__ `, ` __inline__ `, and ` __typeof__ ` forms), and the `//` syntax for comments. This setting also enables trigraphs.

- _libstdc++:_ A traditional C++ standard library that works with GCC and Clang (default).

- _libc++:_ A highly optimized C++ standard library that works only with Clang, and is designed to support new C++11 features."
CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC,Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting,"Compiles reference-counted Objective-C code (when garbage collection is not enabled) to use Automatic Reference Counting. Code compiled using automated reference counting is compatible with other code (such as frameworks) compiled using either manual reference counting (for example, traditional `retain` and `release` messages) or automated reference counting. Using this mode is currently incompatible with compiling code to use Objective-C Garbage Collection."
CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_WEAK,Weak References in Manual Retain Release,Compiles Objective-C code to enable weak references for code compiled with manual retain release (MRR) semantics.
CLANG_LINK_OBJC_RUNTIME,Implicitly Link Objective-C Runtime Support,"When linking a target using Objective-C code, implicitly link in Foundation (and if deploying back to an older OS) a backwards compatibility library to allow newer language features to run on an OS where the runtime support is not natively available. Most targets that use Objective-C should use this, although there are rare cases where a target should opt out of this behavior."
CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES,Enable Modules (C and Objective-C),Enables the use of modules for system APIs. System headers are imported as semantic modules instead of raw headers. This can result in faster builds and project indexing.
CLANG_ENABLE_MODULE_DEBUGGING,Enable Clang Module Debugging,"When this setting is enabled, `clang` will use the shared debug info available in `clang` modules and precompiled headers. This results in smaller build artifacts, faster compile times, and more complete debug info. This setting should only be disabled when building static libraries with debug info for distribution."

This is inherently unsafe, as such headers might cause duplicate definitions when used by any client that imports both the framework and the non-modular includes."
CLANG_ENABLE_MODULE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF,,
CLANG_ENABLE_APP_EXTENSION,,
GCC_CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED_CHAR,'char' Type Is Unsigned,"Enabling this setting causes `char` to be unsigned by default, disabling it causes `char` to be signed by default."
GCC_ENABLE_ASM_KEYWORD,"Allow 'asm', 'inline', 'typeof'","Controls whether `asm`, `inline`, and `typeof` are treated as keywords or whether they can be used as identifiers."
GCC_ENABLE_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS,Recognize Builtin Functions,"Controls whether builtin functions that do not begin with `__builtin_` as prefix are recognized.

GCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca` may become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to `memcpy` may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as a builtin function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are given with `-Wformat` for bad calls to `printf`, when `printf` is built in, and `strlen` is known not to modify global memory."
GCC_ENABLE_TRIGRAPHS,Enable Trigraphs,Controls whether or not trigraphs are permitted in the source code.
GCC_ENABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS,Enable C++ Exceptions,"Enable C++ exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in C++."
GCC_ENABLE_CPP_RTTI,Enable C++ Runtime Types,"Enable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features (`dynamic_cast` and `typeid`). If you don't use those parts of the language, you can save some space by using this flag. Note that exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as needed."
GCC_ENABLE_PASCAL_STRINGS,Recognize Pascal Strings,"Recognize and construct Pascal-style string literals. Its use in new code is discouraged.

Pascal string literals take the form `""\pstring""` . The special escape sequence `\p` denotes the Pascal length byte for the string, and will be replaced at compile time with the number of characters that follow. The `\p` may only appear at the beginning of a string literal, and may not appear in wide string literals or as an integral constant."
GCC_SHORT_ENUMS,Short Enumeration Constants,"Make enums only as large as needed for the range of possible values.

This setting generates code that may not binary compatible with code generated without this setting or with macOS frameworks."
GCC_LINK_WITH_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES,Enable Linking With Shared Libraries,Enabling this option allows linking with the shared libraries. This is the default for most product types.
GCC_ENABLE_FLOATING_POINT_LIBRARY_CALLS,Generate Floating Point Library Calls,Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
CLANG_ENABLE_CPP_STATIC_DESTRUCTORS,Destroy Static Objects,Controls whether variables with static or thread storage duration should have their exit-time destructors run.
GCC_PREFIX_HEADER,Prefix Header,Implicitly include the named header. The path given should either be a project relative path or an absolute path.
GCC_PRECOMPILE_PREFIX_HEADER,Precompile Prefix Header,"Generates a precompiled header for the prefix header, which should reduce overall build times.

Precompiling the prefix header will be most effective if the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change rarely. If the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change frequently, there may be a negative impact to overall build time."
GCC_INCREASE_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_SHARING,Increase Sharing of Precompiled Headers,"Enabling this option will enable increased sharing of precompiled headers among targets that share the same prefix header and precompiled header directory.

Xcode distinguishes between precompiled header (PCH) files by generating a hash value based on the command-line options to the compiler used to create the PCH. Enabling this option will exclude certain compiler options from that hash. Presently this option will exclude search path options (`-I`, `-iquote`, `-isystem`, `-F`, `-L`) from the hash.

Enabling increased sharing of PCH files carries some risk—if two targets use the same prefix header but have different include paths that cause the prefix header to include different files when they are precompiled, then subtle problems may result because one target will use a PCH that was built using files included by the other target. In this case, this option must be turned off in order to enforce correctness."
OTHER_CFLAGS,Other C Flags,"Space-separated list of additional flags to pass to the compiler for C and Objective-C files. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular C or Objective-C compiler flag."
OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS,Other C++ Flags,"Space-separated list of additional flags to pass to the compiler for C++ and Objective-C++ files. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a C++ or Objective-C++ compiler flag."
GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS,Generate Debug Symbols,"Enables or disables generation of debug symbols. When debug symbols are enabled, the level of detail can be controlled by the [Debug Information Format (DEBUG\_INFORMATION\_FORMAT)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev881878d77) setting."
GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL,Optimization Level,"Specifies the degree to which the generated code is optimized for speed and binary size.

- _None:_ Do not optimize. `-O0` With this setting, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent—if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.

- _Fast:_ Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large function. `-O1` With this setting, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. In Apple's compiler, strict aliasing, block reordering, and inter-block scheduling are disabled by default when optimizing.

- _Faster:_ The compiler performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. `-O2` With this setting, the compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining, or register renaming. As compared to the `Fast` setting, this setting increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

- _Fastest:_ Turns on all optimizations specified by the `Faster` setting and also turns on function inlining and register renaming options. This setting may result in a larger binary. `-O3`

- _Fastest, Smallest:_ Optimize for size. This setting enables all `Faster` optimizations that do not typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size. `-Os`

- _Fastest, Aggressive Optimizations:_ This setting enables `Fastest` but also enables aggressive optimizations that may break strict standards compliance but should work well on well-behaved code. `-Ofast`

- _Smallest, Aggressive Size Optimizations:_ This setting enables additional size savings by isolating repetitive code patterns into a compiler generated function. `-Oz`"

- _No:_ Disabled. Do not use link-time optimization.

- _Monolithic Link-Time Optimization:_ This mode performs monolithic link-time optimization of binaries, combining all executable code into a single unit and running aggressive compiler optimizations.

- _Incremental Link-Time Optimization:_ This mode performs partitioned link-time optimization of binaries, inlining between compilation units and running aggressive compiler optimizations on each unit in parallel. This enables fast incremental builds and uses less memory than Monolithic LTO."
GCC_NO_COMMON_BLOCKS,No Common Blocks,"In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file, rather than generating them as common blocks. This has the effect that if the same variable is declared (without `extern`) in two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them."
GCC_REUSE_STRINGS,Make Strings Read-Only,Reuse string literals.
GCC_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC,Generate Position-Dependent Code,"Faster function calls for applications. Not appropriate for shared libraries, which need to be position-independent."
GCC_ENABLE_KERNEL_DEVELOPMENT,Kernel Development Mode,Activating this setting enables kernel development mode.
GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS,Treat Warnings as Errors,Enabling this option causes all warnings to be treated as errors.
GCC_TREAT_IMPLICIT_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS_AS_ERRORS,Treat Missing Function Prototypes as Errors,Causes warnings about missing function prototypes to be treated as errors. Only applies to C and Objective-C.
GCC_TREAT_INCOMPATIBLE_POINTER_TYPE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS,Treat Incompatible Pointer Type Warnings as Errors,Enabling this option causes warnings about incompatible pointer types to be treated as errors.
GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_FIELD_INITIALIZERS,Missing Fields in Structure Initializers,"Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing. For example, the following code would cause such a warning because `x.h` is implicitly zero:

`struct s { int f, g, h; };``struct s x = { 3, 4 };`

This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following modification would not trigger a warning:

`struct s { int f, g, h; };``struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };`"
GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_PROTOTYPES,Missing Function Prototypes,Causes warnings to be emitted about missing prototypes.
GCC_WARN_ABOUT_RETURN_TYPE,Mismatched Return Type,Causes warnings to be emitted when a function with a defined return type (not `void`) contains a return statement without a return-value or when it does not contain any return statements. Also emits a warning when a function with a void return type tries to return a value.
CLANG_WARN_DOCUMENTATION_COMMENTS,Documentation Comments,Warns about issues in documentation comments (`doxygen`-style) such as missing or incorrect documentation tags.
CLANG_WARN_UNREACHABLE_CODE,Unreachable Code,Warns about potentially unreachable code.
CLANG_WARN_QUOTED_INCLUDE_IN_FRAMEWORK_HEADER,Quoted Include In Framework Header,Warns when a quoted include is used instead of a framework style include in a framework header.
CLANG_WARN_NULLABLE_TO_NONNULL_CONVERSION,Incorrect Uses of Nullable Values,"Warns when a nullable expression is used somewhere it’s not allowed, such as when passed as a `_Nonnull` parameter."
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_IMPLICIT_ATOMIC_PROPERTIES,Implicit Atomic Objective-C Properties,Warn about `@property` declarations that are implicitly atomic.
CLANG_WARN_DIRECT_OBJC_ISA_USAGE,Direct usage of 'isa',Warn about direct accesses to the Objective-C `isa` pointer instead of using a runtime API.
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_INTERFACE_IVARS,Interface Declarations of Instance Variables,Warn about instance variable declarations in `@interface`.
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_MISSING_PROPERTY_SYNTHESIS,Implicit Synthesized Properties,"Starting in Xcode 4.4, Apple Clang will implicitly synthesize properties that are not explicitly synthesized using `@synthesize`. This setting warns about such implicit behavior, even though the property is still synthesized. This is essentially a backwards compatibility warning, or for those who wish to continue to explicitly use `@synthesize`."
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_ROOT_CLASS,Unintentional Root Class,"Warn about classes that unintentionally do not subclass a root class, such as `NSObject`."
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_REPEATED_USE_OF_WEAK,Repeatedly using a __weak reference,"Warn about repeatedly using a weak reference without assigning the weak reference to a strong reference. This is often symptomatic of a race condition where the weak reference can become `nil` between accesses, resulting in unexpected behavior. Assigning to temporary strong reference ensures the object stays alive during the related accesses."
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_EXPLICIT_OWNERSHIP_TYPE,Implicit ownership types on out parameters,"Warn about implicit ownership types on Objective-C object references as out parameters. For example, declaring a parameter with type `NSObject**` will produce a warning because the compiler will assume that the out parameter's ownership type is `__autoreleasing`."
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_IMPLICIT_RETAIN_SELF,Implicit retain of 'self' within blocks,"Warn about implicit retains of `self` within blocks, which can create a retain-cycle."
GCC_WARN_NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR,Nonvirtual Destructor,"Warn when a class declares an nonvirtual destructor that should probably be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically. This is only active for C++ or Objective-C++ sources."
GCC_WARN_HIDDEN_VIRTUAL_FUNCTIONS,Overloaded Virtual Functions,"Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class.

For example, in the following example, the `A` class version of `f()` is hidden in `B`.

`struct A {`` virtual void f();``};``struct B: public A {`` void f(int);``};`

As a result, the following code will fail to compile.

`B* b;``b-&gt;f();`

This setting only applies to C++ and Objective-C++ sources."
CLANG_WARN__EXIT_TIME_DESTRUCTORS,Exit-Time C++ Destructors,Warn about destructors for C++ objects that are called when an application is terminating.
CLANG_WARN__ARC_BRIDGE_CAST_NONARC,Using __bridge Casts Outside of ARC,"Warn about using `__bridge` casts when not using ARC, where they have no effect."
CLANG_WARN__DUPLICATE_METHOD_MATCH,Duplicate Method Definitions,Warn about declaring the same method more than once within the same `@interface`.
GCC_WARN_TYPECHECK_CALLS_TO_PRINTF,Typecheck Calls to printf/scanf,"Check calls to `printf` and `scanf` to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense."
GCC_WARN_INITIALIZER_NOT_FULLY_BRACKETED,Initializer Not Fully Bracketed,"Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed. In the following example, the initializer for `a` is not fully bracketed, but the initializer for `b` is fully bracketed.

`int a`2``2` = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };``int b`2``2` = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };`"
GCC_WARN_MISSING_PARENTHESES,Missing Braces and Parentheses,"Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence causes confusion. Also, warn about constructions where there may be confusion as to which `if` statement an `else` branch belongs. For example:

`{`` if (a)`` if (b)`` foo ();`` else`` bar ();``}`

In C, every `else` branch belongs to the innermost possible `if` statement, which in the example above is `if (b)`. This is often not what the programmer expects, as illustrated by indentation used in the example above. This build setting causes GCC to issue a warning when there is the potential for this confusion. To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost `if` statement so there is no way the `else` could belong to the enclosing `if`. For example:

`{`` if (a)`` {`` if (b)`` foo ();`` else`` bar ();`` }``}`"
GCC_WARN_CHECK_SWITCH_STATEMENTS,Check Switch Statements,Warn whenever a switch statement has an index of enumeral type and lacks a case for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration. The presence of a default label prevents this warning. Case labels outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is used.
GCC_WARN_UNUSED_FUNCTION,Unused Functions,Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a noninline static function is unused.
GCC_WARN_UNUSED_LABEL,Unused Labels,Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.
CLANG_WARN_EMPTY_BODY,Empty Loop Bodies,Warn about loop bodies that are suspiciously empty.
GCC_WARN_UNINITIALIZED_AUTOS,Uninitialized Variables,"Warn if a variable might be clobbered by a `setjmp` call or if an automatic variable is used without prior initialization.

The compiler may not detect all cases where an automatic variable is initialized or all usage patterns that may lead to use prior to initialization. You can toggle between the normal uninitialized value checking or the more aggressive (conservative) checking, which finds more issues but the checking is much stricter."
GCC_WARN_UNKNOWN_PRAGMAS,Unknown Pragma,"Warn when a `#pragma` directive is encountered that is not understood by GCC. If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files. This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the `-Wall` command-line option."
GCC_WARN_INHIBIT_ALL_WARNINGS,Inhibit All Warnings,Inhibit all warning messages.
GCC_WARN_PEDANTIC,Pedantic Warnings,"Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any `-std` option used."
GCC_WARN_SHADOW,Hidden Local Variables,"Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or global variable or whenever a builtin function is shadowed."
GCC_WARN_FOUR_CHARACTER_CONSTANTS,Four Character Literals,"Warn about four-char literals (for example, macOS-style `OSTypes`: `'APPL'`)."
CLANG_WARN_SUSPICIOUS_IMPLICIT_CONVERSION,Suspicious Implicit Conversions,Warn about various implicit conversions that can lose information or are otherwise suspicious.
CLANG_WARN_CONSTANT_CONVERSION,Implicit Constant Conversions,"Warn about implicit conversions of constant values that cause the constant value to change, either through a loss of precision, or entirely in its meaning."
CLANG_WARN_INT_CONVERSION,Implicit Integer to Pointer Conversions,"Warn about implicit conversions between pointers and integers. For example, this can catch issues when one incorrectly intermixes using `NSNumber*`'s and raw integers."
CLANG_WARN_BOOL_CONVERSION,Implicit Boolean Conversions,"Warn about implicit conversions to boolean values that are suspicious. For example, writing `if (foo)` where `foo` is the name a function will trigger a warning."
CLANG_WARN_ENUM_CONVERSION,Implicit Enum Conversions,"Warn about implicit conversions between different kinds of enum values. For example, this can catch issues when using the wrong enum flag as an argument to a function or method."
CLANG_WARN_FLOAT_CONVERSION,Implicit Float Conversions,Warn about implicit conversions that turn floating-point numbers into integers.
CLANG_WARN_NON_LITERAL_NULL_CONVERSION,Implicit Non-Literal Null Conversions,Warn about non-literal expressions that evaluate to zero being treated as a null pointer.
CLANG_WARN_OBJC_LITERAL_CONVERSION,Implicit Objective-C Literal Conversions,Warn about implicit conversions from Objective-C literals to values of incompatible type.
CLANG_WARN_MISSING_NOESCAPE,Missing Noescape Annotation,Warn about noescape annotations that are missing in a method's signature.
CLANG_WARN_PRAGMA_PACK,Suspicious Pragma Pack,Warn when a translation unit is missing terminating '#pragma pack (pop)' directives or when the '#pragma pack' state immediately after an #include is different from the state immediately before.
CLANG_WARN_PRIVATE_MODULE,Outdated Private Module Map,Warn about private modules that do not use the recommended private module layout.
CLANG_WARN_VEXING_PARSE,Ambiguous C++ Parsing Situation,Warn about a parsing ambiguity between a variable declaration and a function-style cast.
CLANG_WARN_DELETE_NON_VIRTUAL_DTOR,Deleting Instance of Polymorphic Class with No Virtual Destructor,Warn when deleting an instance of a polymorphic class with virtual functions but without a virtual destructor.
CLANG_WARN_ASSIGN_ENUM,Out-of-Range Enum Assignments,Warn about assigning integer constants to enum values that are out of the range of the enumerated type.
GCC_WARN_SIGN_COMPARE,Sign Comparison,Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
GCC_WARN_MULTIPLE_DEFINITION_TYPES_FOR_SELECTOR,,
GCC_WARN_STRICT_SELECTOR_MATCH,Strict Selector Matching,"Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type `id` or `Class`. When this setting is disabled, the compiler will omit such warnings if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size and alignment."
GCC_WARN_UNDECLARED_SELECTOR,Undeclared Selector,"Warn if a `@selector(...)` expression referring to an undeclared selector is found. A selector is considered undeclared if no method with that name has been declared before the `@selector(...)` expression, either explicitly in an `@interface` or `@protocol` declaration, or implicitly in an `@implementation` section. This option always performs its checks as soon as a `@selector(...)` expression is found, while `-Wselector` only performs its checks in the final stage of compilation. This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors must be declared before being used."
CLANG_WARN_DEPRECATED_OBJC_IMPLEMENTATIONS,Overriding Deprecated Objective-C Methods,Warn if an Objective-C class either subclasses a deprecated class or overrides a method that has been marked deprecated or unavailable.
CLANG_WARN_CXX0X_EXTENSIONS,Using C++11 extensions in earlier versions of C++,"When compiling C++ code using a language standard older than C++11, warn about the use of C++11 extensions."

GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VALUE,Unused Values,Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS,Enable Exceptions,"Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ and Objective-C that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in other languages. You may also wish to disable this option if you are compiling older programs that don't use exception handling."
GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS,Enable Objective-C Exceptions,This setting enables `@try`/`@catch`/`@throw` syntax for handling exceptions in Objective-C code. Only applies to Objective-C.

GCC_WARN_ABOUT_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS,Deprecated Functions,"Warn about the use of deprecated functions, variables, and types (as indicated by the `deprecated` attribute)."
GCC_WARN_ABOUT_INVALID_OFFSETOF_MACRO,Undefined Use of offsetof Macro,"Unchecking this setting will suppress warnings from applying the `offsetof` macro to a non-POD type. According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying `offsetof` to a non-POD type is undefined. In existing C++ implementations, however, `offsetof` typically gives meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds of non-POD types, such as a simple struct that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a constructor. This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning about it.

The restrictions on `offsetof` may be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard."

LD_NO_PIE,Generate Position-Dependent Executable,"Activating this setting will prevent Xcode from building a main executable that is position independent (PIE). When targeting macOS 10.7 or later, PIE is the default for main executables, so activating this setting will change that behavior. When targeting OS X 10.6 or earlier, or when building for i386, PIE is not the default, so activating this setting does nothing.

You cannot create a PIE from `.o` files compiled with `-mdynamic-no-pic`. Using PIE means the codegen is less optimal, but the address randomization adds some security."

By default, a separate file will be written for each architecture and build variant, and these will be generated in the Intermediates directory for the target whose product is being linked."
LINK_WITH_STANDARD_LIBRARIES,Link With Standard Libraries,"When this setting is enabled, the compiler driver will automatically pass its standard libraries to the linker to use during linking. If desired, this flag can be used to disable linking with the standard libraries, and then individual libraries can be passed as [Other Linker Flags (OTHER\_LDFLAGS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev4fc8ef90a)."

PRESERVE_DEAD_CODE_INITS_AND_TERMS,Don't Dead-Strip Inits and Terms,"Activating this setting, in combination with the [Dead Code Stripping (DEAD\_CODE\_STRIPPING)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev9ed8cb7ad) (`-dead_strip`) option, causes the `-no_dead_strip_inits_and_terms` flag to be passed to `ld(1)` via `cc(1)` to disable dead code stripping for initialization and termination routines. This option should not be used without the aforementioned [Dead Code Stripping (DEAD\_CODE\_STRIPPING)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev9ed8cb7ad) option."
BUNDLE_LOADER,Bundle Loader,Specifies the executable that will load the bundle output file being linked. Undefined symbols from the bundle are checked against the specified executable as if it is one of the dynamic libraries the bundle was linked with.
ORDER_FILE,Order File,"The path to a file that alters the order in which functions and data are laid out.

For each section in the output file, any symbol in that section that are specified in the order file is moved to the start of its section and laid out in the same order as in the order file. Order files are text files with one symbol name per line. Lines starting with a `#` are comments. A symbol name may be optionally preceded with its object file leafname and a colon (for example, `foo.o:_foo`). This is useful for static functions/data that occur in multiple files. A symbol name may also be optionally preceded with the architecture (for example, `ppc:_foo` or `ppc:foo.o:_foo`). This enables you to have one order file that works for multiple architectures. Literal C-strings may be ordered by quoting the string in the order file (for example, `""Hello, world\n""`).

Generally you should not specify an order file in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations."

LD_DONT_RUN_DEDUPLICATION,,
LD_OBJC_ABI_VERSION,,
LD_QUOTE_LINKER_ARGUMENTS_FOR_COMPILER_DRIVER,Quote Linker Arguments,"This setting controls whether arguments to the linker should be quoted using `-Xlinker`. By default, Xcode invokes the linker by invoking the driver of the compiler used to build the source files in the target, and passing `-Xlinker` to quote arguments will cause the compiler driver to pass them through to the linker (rather than trying to evaluate them within the driver). By default, this setting is enabled. Disabling it will cause Xcode to not use `-Xlinker` to pass arguments to the linker. Disabling this setting is useful if the target has instructed Xcode to use an alternate linker (for example, by setting the `LD` setting to the path to another linker) and that alternate linker does not recognize `-Xlinker`."

The Standard (`y`) option will cause all `yacc` source files in the same target to produce the same output file, and it is not recommended for targets containing multiple `yacc` source files."
YACC_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES,Insert #line Directives,"Enabling this option causes `yacc` to insert the `#line` directives in the generated code. The `#line` directives let the C compiler relate errors in the generated code to the user's original code. If this option is disabled, `#line` directives specified by the user in the source file will still be retained."
YACC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_DIRECTIVES,Generate Debugging Directives,Enabling this option changes the preprocessor directives generated by `yacc` so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the compiled code.

The order is from highest to lowest precedence. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. This setting is very similar to ""Header Search Paths"", except that headers are passed to the compiler in a way that suppresses most warnings for headers found in system search paths. If the compiler doesn't support the concept of system header search paths, then the search paths are appended to any existing header search paths defined in ""Header Search Paths""."

OPENCL_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS,OpenCL Preprocessor Macros,Space-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`.
OPENCL_MAD_ENABLE,Use MAD,"Allow `a * b + c` to be replaced by a `mad` instruction. The `mad` computes `a * b + c` with reduced accuracy. For example, some `OpenCL` devices implement `mad` as truncate the result of `a * b` before adding it to `c`.

This is intended to be a performance optimization."
OPENCL_FAST_RELAXED_MATH,Relax IEEE Compliance,"This allows optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard and the `OpenCL` numerical compliance requirements defined in in section 7.4 for single-precision floating-point, section 9.3.9 for double-precision floating-point, and edge case behavior in section 7.5 of the `OpenCL` 1.1 specification.

This is intended to be a performance optimization.

This option causes the preprocessor macro ` __FAST_RELAXED_MATH__ ` to be defined in the `OpenCL` program."
OPENCL_DENORMS_ARE_ZERO,Flush denorms to zero,"This option controls how single precision and double precision denormalized numbers are handled. If specified as a build option, the single precision denormalized numbers may be flushed to zero; double precision denormalized numbers may also be flushed to zero if the optional extension for double precision is supported. This is intended to be a performance hint and the `OpenCL` compiler can choose not to flush denorms to zero if the device supports single precision (or double precision) denormalized numbers.

This option is ignored for single precision numbers if the device does not support single precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG`.

This option is ignored for double precision numbers if the device does not support double precision or if it does support double precision but not double precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG`.

This flag only applies for scalar and vector single precision floating-point variables and computations on these floating-point variables inside a program. It does not apply to reading from or writing to image objects."
OPENCL_AUTO_VECTORIZE_ENABLE,Auto-vectorizer,Auto-vectorizes the `OpenCL` kernels for the CPU. This setting takes effect only for the CPU. This makes it possible to write a single kernel that is portable and performant across CPUs and GPUs.
OPENCL_DOUBLE_AS_SINGLE,Double as single,Treat double precision floating-point expression as a single precision floating-point expression. This option is available for GPUs only.
OPENCL_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL,Optimization Level,"- _None:_ Do not optimize. `-O0` With this setting, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.

- _Fast:_ Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large function. `-O, -O1` With this setting, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. In Apple's compiler, strict aliasing, block reordering, and inter-block scheduling are disabled by default when optimizing.

- _Faster:_ The compiler performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. `-O2` With this setting, the compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining, or register renaming. As compared to the `Fast` setting, this setting increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

- _Fastest:_ Turns on all optimizations specified by the `Faster` setting and also turns on function inlining and register renaming options. This setting may result in a larger binary. `-O3`

- _Fastest, smallest:_ Optimize for size. This setting enables all `Faster` optimizations that do not typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size. `-Os`"

The matched text given in `yytext` will have the preserved case (for example, it will not be folded)."
LEX_SUPPRESS_DEFAULT_RULE,Suppress Default Rule,"Enabling this option causes the default rule (that unmatched scanner input is echoed to `stdout`) to be suppressed. If the scanner encounters input that does not match any of its rules, it aborts with an error. This option is useful for finding holes in a scanner's rule set."
LEX_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES,Insert #line Directives,"Enabling this option instructs `lex` to insert `#line` directives so error messages in the actions will be correctly located with respect to either the original `lex` input file (if the errors are due to code in the input file), or `lex.yy.c` (if the errors are `lex`'s fault). This option is enabled by default; disabling it passes a flag to `lex` to not insert `#line` directives."

Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. See [Always Search User Paths (Deprecated) (ALWAYS\_SEARCH\_USER\_PATHS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#devc34d7d3e9) for more details on how this setting is used. If the compiler doesn't support the concept of user headers, then the search paths are prepended to the any existing header search paths defined in [Header Search Paths (HEADER\_SEARCH\_PATHS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev3c9f85d97)."
REZ_SEARCH_PATHS,Rez Search Paths,"This is a list of paths to search for files with resource manager resources. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted."
ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS,Always Search User Paths (Deprecated),"This setting is deprecated as of Xcode 8.3 and may not be supported in future versions. It is recommended that you disable the setting.

If enabled, both `#include <header.h>`-style and `#include ""header.h""`-style directives search the paths in [User Header Search Paths (USER\_HEADER\_SEARCH\_PATHS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#deved642222b) before [Header Search Paths (HEADER\_SEARCH\_PATHS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev3c9f85d97). As a consequence, user headers, such as your own `String.h` header, have precedence over system headers when using `#include <header.h>`. This is done using the `-iquote` flag for the paths provided in [User Header Search Paths (USER\_HEADER\_SEARCH\_PATHS)](itcaec37c2a6.html#deved642222b). If disabled and your compiler fully supports separate user paths, user headers are only accessible with `#include ""header.h""`-style preprocessor directives.

For backwards compatibility reasons, this setting is enabled by default. Disabling it is strongly recommended."
ENABLE_DEFAULT_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS,,
INCLUDED_RECURSIVE_SEARCH_PATH_SUBDIRECTORIES,Sub-Directories to Include in Recursive Searches,"This is a list of `fnmatch()`-style patterns of file or directory names to include when performing a recursive search. By default, this is empty and is only customized when you want to provide exceptions to the list of filename patterns provided in [Sub-Directories to Exclude in Recursive Searches (EXCLUDED\_RECURSIVE\_SEARCH\_PATH\_SUBDIRECTORIES)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev454fb3164)."
EXCLUDED_RECURSIVE_SEARCH_PATH_SUBDIRECTORIES,Sub-Directories to Exclude in Recursive Searches,"This is a list of `fnmatch()`-style patterns of file or directory names to exclude when performing a recursive search. By default, this is set to `*.nib *.lproj *.framework *.gch *.xcode (*) .DS_Store CVS .svn .git .hg`. Normally, if you override this value you should include the default values via the `$(inherited)` macro."
VERSIONING_SYSTEM,Versioning System,"Selects the process used for version-stamping generated files.

- _None:_ Use no versioning system.

- _Apple Generic:_ Use the current project version setting. `apple-generic`"
MARKETING_VERSION,Marketing Version,This setting defines the user-visible version of the project. The value corresponds to the `CFBundleShortVersionString` key in your app's Info.plist.
CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION,Current Project Version,"This setting defines the current version of the project. The value must be a integer or floating point number, such as `57` or `365.8`."
VERSION_INFO_PREFIX,Versioning Name Prefix,Used as a prefix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. If you prefix your exported symbols you will probably want to set this to the same prefix.
VERSION_INFO_SUFFIX,Versioning Name Suffix,Used as a suffix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. This is rarely used.
VERSION_INFO_BUILDER,Versioning Username,This defines a reference to the user performing a build to be included in the generated Apple Generic Versioning stub. Defaults to the value of the `USER` environment variable.
VERSION_INFO_EXPORT_DECL,Generated Versioning Variables,"This defines a prefix string for the version info symbol declaration in the generated Apple Generic Versioning stub. This can be used, for example, to add an optional `export` keyword to the version symbol declaration. This should rarely be changed."
VERSION_INFO_FILE,Generated Versioning Source Filename,"Used to specify a name for the source file that will be generated by Apple Generic Versioning and compiled into your product. By default, this is set to `$(PRODUCT_NAME)_vers.c`."
DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT,Debug Information Format,"The type of debug information to produce.

- _DWARF:_ Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug information format. `dwarf`

- _DWARF with dSYM File:_ Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug information format, and Xcode will also produce a dSYM file containing the debug information from the individual object files (except that a dSYM file is not needed and will not be created for static library or object file products). `dwarf-with-dsym`"

SCAN_ALL_SOURCE_FILES_FOR_INCLUDES,Scan All Source Files for Includes,"Activating this setting will cause all source files to be scanned for includes (for example, of header files) when computing the dependency graph, in which case if an included file is changed then the including file will be rebuilt next time a target containing it is built. Normally only certain types of files, such as C-language source files, are scanned.

This setting is useful if your project contains files of unusual types, which are compiled using a custom build rule."
ENABLE_BITCODE,Enable Bitcode,"Activating this setting indicates that the target or project should generate bitcode during compilation for platforms and architectures that support it. For Archive builds, bitcode will be generated in the linked binary for submission to the App Store. For other builds, the compiler and linker will check whether the code complies with the requirements for bitcode generation, but will not generate actual bitcode."
HIDE_BITCODE_SYMBOLS,,
BITCODE_GENERATION_MODE,,
STRIP_BITCODE_FROM_COPIED_FILES,,
PRECOMPS_INCLUDE_HEADERS_FROM_BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR,Precompiled Header Uses Files From Build Directory,"This setting allows for better control of sharing precompiled prefix header files between projects. By default, Xcode assumes that the prefix header file may include header files from the build directory if the build directory is outside of the project directory. Xcode cannot determine this ahead of time since other projects may not have been built into the shared build directory at the time the information is needed.

If your prefix file never includes files from the build directory you may set this to `NO` to improve sharing of precompiled headers. If the prefix does use files from a build directory that is inside your project directory, you may set this to `YES` to avoid unintended sharing that may result in build failures."
EXCLUDED_INSTALLSRC_SUBDIRECTORY_PATTERNS,,
SEPARATE_SYMBOL_EDIT,Separately Edit Symbols,"Activating this setting when the linked product's symbols are to be edited will cause editing to occur via a separate invocation of `nmedit(1)`. Otherwise editing will occur during linking, if possible."
DYLIB_CURRENT_VERSION,Current Library Version,"This setting defines the current version of any framework built by the project. As with [Current Project Version (CURRENT\_PROJECT\_VERSION)](itcaec37c2a6.html#devd516a860b), the value must be an integer or floating point number, such as `57` or `365.8`. By default, it is set to `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`. See [Dynamic Library Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/DynamicLibraryDesignGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002013-SW19) in [Dynamic Library Programming Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/000-Introduction/Introduction.html) for details on assigning version numbers of dynamic libraries."
DYLIB_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION,Compatibility Version,"Determines the compatibility version of the resulting library, bundle, or framework binary.

DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME_BASE,Dynamic Library Install Name Base,Sets the base value for the internal `install path` (`LC_ID_DYLIB`) in a dynamic library. This will be combined with the [EXECUTABLE\_PATH](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev5a0a1bb80) to form the full install path. Setting [Dynamic Library Install Name (LD\_DYLIB\_INSTALL\_NAME)](itcaec37c2a6.html#devbb966571b) directly will override this setting. This setting defaults to the target's [Installation Directory (INSTALL\_PATH)](itcaec37c2a6.html#devabd541cd5). It is ignored when building any product other than a dynamic library.
SECTORDER_FLAGS,Symbol Ordering Flags,"These flags are typically used to specify options for ordering symbols within segments, for example the `-sectorder` option to `ld`.

Generally you should not specify symbol ordering options in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations."
WARNING_LDFLAGS,Warning Linker Flags,"These flags are passed with linker invocations, and by default give the `-no_arch_warnings` flag to the linker to avoid many warnings being generated during multi-architecture builds."
OTHER_LDFLAGS,Other Linker Flags,Options defined in this setting are passed to invocations of the linker.
OTHER_LIBTOOLFLAGS,Other Librarian Flags,"Options defined in this setting are passed to all invocations of the archive librarian, which is used to generate static libraries."
GENERATE_MASTER_OBJECT_FILE,Perform Single-Object Prelink,"Activating this setting will cause the object files built by a target to be prelinked using `ld -r` into a single object file, and that object file will then be linked into the final product. This is useful to force the linker to resolve symbols and link the object files into a single module before building a static library. Also, a separate set of link flags can be applied to the prelink allowing additional control over, for instance, exported symbols."
PRELINK_LIBS,Prelink libraries,Additional libraries to pass when performing a single-object prelink.
PRELINK_FLAGS,Single-Object Prelink Flags,Additional flags to pass when performing a single-object prelink.
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER,Product Bundle Identifier,"A string that uniquely identifies the bundle. The string should be in reverse DNS format using only alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`), the dot (`.`), and the hyphen (`-`). This value is used as the `CFBundleIdentifier` in the `Info.plist` of the built bundle."
PRODUCT_NAME,Product Name,This is the basename of the product generated by the target.
EXECUTABLE_PREFIX,Executable Prefix,"The prefix used for the executable product generated by the target, which has a default value based on the product type."

CREATE_INFOPLIST_SECTION_IN_BINARY,Create Info.plist Section in Binary,Enabling this setting will create a section in the product's linked binary containing the processed `Info.plist` file for the target. This setting only applies to command-line tool targets.
APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_FILES,Convert Copied Files,"Enabling this setting will cause files in the target's Copy Files build phases to be processed by build rules. For example, property list files (`.plist`) and strings files will be converted as specified by [Property List Output Encoding (PLIST\_FILE\_OUTPUT\_FORMAT)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev70f6976ed) and [Strings File Output Encoding (STRINGS\_FILE\_OUTPUT\_ENCODING)](itcaec37c2a6.html#dev8d71dff90), respectively."

ON_DEMAND_RESOURCES_PREFETCH_ORDER,On Demand Resources Prefetch Order,"Once your app is installed, this defined a set of On Demand Resources tags that should be downloaded. These tags are downloaded after the initial installation of your application, and will be downloaded in the order the tags provided in the list from first to last."
ASSET_PACK_MANIFEST_URL_PREFIX,Asset Pack Manifest URL Prefix,"If set to anything other than the empty string, every URL in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` file will consist of this string with the name of the asset pack appended. If not set, the URLs in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` will be formed as appropriate for the build location of the asset packs. The prefix string is not escaped or quoted in any way, so any necessary escaping must be part of the URL string. This setting affects only URLs in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` file — it does not affect where asset packs are built in the local file system."
